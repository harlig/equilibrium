# Equilibrium
Equilibrium is a dungeon crawler. You'll collect orbs throughout the dungeon which will affect your scale of equilibrium. Depending on where you are in the scale, you'll be offered different rewards fitting for that portion of the scale. The further away from equilibrium you are, the more powerful rewards you'll be offered -- but be careful if  you get too far away from equilibrium! Enemies drop orb types influenced by what type of damage you deal to them, so you can balance your equilibrium state.
